Medical Coding Basics:
- Medical coding involves translating healthcare diagnoses, procedures, and services into standardized codes.
- Common coding systems include:
  - ICD-10: Used for diagnoses (e.g., J45.909 for "Unspecified asthma, uncomplicated").
  - CPT: Used for procedures (e.g., 99213 for a standard office visit).
  - HCPCS: Used for supplies and services (e.g., E0110 for crutches).
- Accuracy is critical to ensure proper billing and reimbursement.

Revenue Cycle Management (RCM):
- RCM is the financial process of managing claims, payments, and revenue in healthcare.
- Key steps in RCM:
  - Patient registration and insurance verification.
  - Charge capture and coding.
  - Claim submission to payers.
  - Payment posting and denial management.
  - Patient billing for remaining balances.
- Effective RCM reduces claim denials and improves cash flow.
